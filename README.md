# FindGNTTokenTrader
Find Golem Network Token (GNT) TokenTrader Information

This script will list the TokenTrade contracts created by the TokenTraderFactory contract deployed to https://etherscan.io/address/0xc4af56cd5254aef959d4bce2f75874007808b701 .

## Background
For further information on the TokenTrader and TokenTraderFactory contracts, see:
* https://www.bokconsulting.com.au/blog/trustless-token-selling-contract/
* https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/5cnl58/trustless_gnt_selling_contract/

## Notes
* This scripts list all deployed TokenTrader, even those deployed with some errors. The Sell price and Units fields for the TokenTrade deployed with errors is normally crazily incorrect.
* If you do want to try purchasing GNTs from these contracts, test with  a small amount first.
* This is just a tool for finding the contracts. Your use of the contracts is your own responsibility!
